- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @dcndn4.. I have been in accounting for a long time, originally in small companies and more recently in nonprofits, in the Minneapolis area. I have especially enjoyed optimal implementations of batch-based accounting software such as MIP, as it's really a huge database. Originally I'd wanted to go in to CSci many years ago, and now have decided to return to that and merge the two areas into a new career path. This profile was prompted by another book resource: 'GitHub for dummies' from Wiley, by Sarah Guthals, PhD and Phil Haack, former Eng Leaders at GitHub.
- Career History -Computer includes Pascal use very long ago, Wumpus and all..; Unix briefly during the very accelerated-time-days of the early internet, with protocol stacks and dear BBEdit and (very filtered) Slashdot and so much churning; a period working as an implementation consultant for Great Plains Dynamics back when installation took quite a while and was quite a thing (and answering a customers' question about *why* didn't it work last time, and would it *for sure* work this time? was not easy)(thank goodness for MacinTouch and the rest of the Mac community).. also using EDI and databases such as 4D and Access and FMP and lots of Mac based accounting systems. 
- Career History -Accounting includes all day-to-day functionality, reporting, and financial audit prep, as well as related functionality such as PR and HR. 
- Career History - Writing: I've also always had a strong interest in the written word. I've been in editorial positions (along with accounting work), and also for a time explored book indexing. Also am a puzzle enthusiast. And just always like to write, with the slightest possible excuse, like now, this. 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in joining the FinTech community in some way that contributes to the collective well-being (ESG, etc). Financial Analysis interests me, am considering working on the SEI exam. Also since much of my career has been about migrating the best of legacy systems into the current paradigm, am considering learning R and Tableau in order to have as much flexibility as possible and help transitions from one to the other as applicable. And maybe SWIFT (the language, not the State of Minnesota website which I'm already very familiar with). And everything else in the top 20 positions on the TIOBE list (she said earnestly)! Just kidding.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning via the FinTech Bootcamp via University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, which covers a variety of technologies including: Python, SQL, Big Data, Ethereum, Blockchain and Machine Learning..
-  üíûÔ∏è Also, I have to say, I really appreciate good accounting software, and would be excited to join that sort of process as well. Some of my favorite experiences of the last twenty years include the awesome ‚ú®MIP‚ú® (of Abila). Really loved how much detail was able to be integrated in to transactions, the error-prevention mechanisms, the review abilities, and possibly most of all the reporting capabilities. Other notable work tools have incuded PeopleSoft, Great Plains Dynamics, and Paylocity.

- I won't ever work in a state or for a company based in a state that has an SB8-type law currently in place. I'd also like to never work in a state or for a company based in a state that ever has had an SB8-type law previously on the books.
