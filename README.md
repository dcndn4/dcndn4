- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcndn4.. I have been in accounting for a long time, originally in small companies and more recently in nonprofits, in the Minneapolis area. I have especially enjoyed optimal implementations of accounting software such as MIP, which I really like. Originally I'd wanted to go in to CSci many years ago, and now have decided to return to that and merge the two areas into a new career path.
- History includes Pascal use very long ago, Wumpus and all..; Unix briefly during the very accelerated-time-days of the early internet, with protocol stacks and dear BBEdit and so much churning; a period working as an implementation consultant for Great Plains Dynamics back when installation took quite a while and was quite a thing (and answering a customers' question about *why* didn't it work last time, and would it *for sure* work this time? was not easy).. also using EDI and databases such as 4D and Access and FMP and lots of Mac based accounting systems. And then just more non-IT-focused work exposure to applications and OS's within accounting and pr work functions since then. 
- 👀 I’m interested in joining the FinTech community (domain details pending, but ESG investing has always been an interest and helping with that definitely appeals to me) and just contributing to the collective well-being.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via the UMN boot camp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TBD
