- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcndn4.. I have been in accounting for a long time, originally in small companies and more recently in nonprofits, in the Minneapolis area. I have especially enjoyed optimal implementations of accounting software such as MIP, which I really like. Originally I'd wanted to go in to CSci many years ago, and now have decided to return to that and merge the two areas into a new career path.
- 👀 I’m interested in joining the FinTech community and contributing to the collective well-being.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via the UMN boot camp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TBD
