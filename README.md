- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @dcndn4.. I have been in accounting for a long time, originally in small companies and more recently in nonprofits, in the Minneapolis area. I have especially enjoyed optimal implementations of accounting software such as MIP, which I really like. Originally I'd wanted to go in to CSci many years ago, and now have decided to return to that and merge the two areas into a new career path.
- History includes Pascal use very long ago, Wumpus and all..; Unix briefly during the very accelerated-time-days of the early internet, with protocol stacks and dear BBEdit and (very filtered) Slashdot and so much churning; a period working as an implementation consultant for Great Plains Dynamics back when installation took quite a while and was quite a thing (and answering a customers' question about *why* didn't it work last time, and would it *for sure* work this time? was not easy).. also using EDI and databases such as 4D and Access and FMP and lots of Mac based accounting systems. And then just more non-IT-focused work exposure to applications and OS's within accounting and pr work functions since then. 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in joining the FinTech community (domain details pending, but ESG investing has always been an interest and helping with that definitely appeals to me) and just contributing to the collective well-being.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning via the UMN boot camp.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ESG investing and related topics, which have actually been a huge interest of mine for decades. In the background the last months and recent years, it's gone from total silence to actual growing activity, but I hadn't paid much attention because it wasn't what my work was focused on. Now I have the opportunity to re-align my work so that it can directly include ESG investing-related activities.
- Also, I have to say, I really appreciate good accounting software, and would be excited to join that sort of process as well. Some of my favorite experiences of the last five years include the awesome ‚ú®MIP‚ú® (of Abila), and my implementation of it that I used for seven years very contentedly. Really loved how much detail was able to be integrated in to transactions, the error-prevention mechanisms, the review abilities, and possibly most of all the reporting capabilities. Contrasting to that, also recently used PeopleSoft at a quite-large institition, and that was.. boggling. Debits and credits in the same column (positive v negative amounts), with encumbrances in the other column (also positive and negative) for past, present and future salary amounts. All the approval steps built in to the software.. and the documentation built-in (and used). Also: Paylocity for payroll, in conjunction with GP Dynamics. Very effective process of the timecards being in Dynamics, and reviewed there and certain adjustments (with approval) being able to be made there (in particular in regarding to union contract stipulations for the 3 different unions in place), and then the transfer process to Paylocity, with other review/changes made there (in particular relating to benefits, organization-wide aspects, etc. So, while not 'new' in the same sense, would really be delightful.
- Mouse computing was never my favorite, have always been a keyboard enthusiast, so getting back to the command line is bliss (also, film by that name - highly recommend).
